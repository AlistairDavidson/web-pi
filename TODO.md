apps folder that contains git submodules

management page (replaces the panic-endpoint idea) — rollback AND applying changes in one place:
- the one unmodifiable part of the software: programmatic enforcement — the apply step rejects any patch that changes it from within the container; it can only be modified in the original project
- whole page, designed after the split lands (its "protected from modification" property is exactly what the split makes enforceable); handles picking a git commit, rebuilding, swapping, basic feedback


group sessions by app
ignore pi sessions not related to this project or one of its apps
console is an app
scheduler is an app
Top menu with all apps
new app
rename app
set app icon
delete app
console sidebar for when in other apps (in which case maybe console isn't an app)

self-naming sessions

Zed editor as a webapp
side-tab bar lets you open a given app
  pi
  zed
  terminal  
  app preview
generalise pi -> any agent

Better auth

when it stabilises, maybe build on pi-durable (is tmux still necessary with this?)

grab soothing-booking's approach to APIs and error handling

low priority xterm official addons:
  unicode-graphemes - emoji/combining chars currently render wrong-width in agent output (6.0-only on npm, experimental)

  font decision first, then: bundled mono webfont via web-fonts addon (needs xterm 6.1-beta) + ligatures if a ligature font
  skip: attach (our WS JSON protocol is richer: attach modes, resize, errors, status), canvas (deprecated, removed in xterm 6)

  search addon + ctrl+F bar (wa-input cluster in terminal toolbar, NOT the session sidebar - 15s innerHTML poll eats state) server backfill via `tmux capture-pane -S -5000 -p` written to WS on attach so resumed sessions have searchable scrollback
  
  serialize - "download transcript" / "copy output" button, zero server changes; maybe e2e assertions on terminal state
