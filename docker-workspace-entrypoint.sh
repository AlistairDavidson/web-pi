# web-pi workspace entrypoint — the working half of the privilege split
# (DESIGN_REVIEW §1.1). Runs as user `workspace` (uid 2000) from the SAME
# image as the web service: this container owns the tmux server and every
# pi session; the web container only ever attaches as a client. Verified
# mechanics (tmux 3.3a):
#   - the socket is created 0600 regardless of umask → chmod 0660 + chgrp
#     shared-group after start; the socket dir must be 2770 setgid (the
#     compose init container sets that up);
#   - `server-access -a <name>` admits the web user by NAME (resolved in
#     this container's /etc/passwd — same image, so `node` exists);
#   - umask 0007 here is inherited by everything the tmux server spawns
#     (panes, pi) — that is what makes pi's session files group-readable
#     so the web sidebar can list them without being able to write them;
#   - an empty tmux server dies instantly under default exit-empty, and a
#     separate `set-option` races that death — exit-empty off must ride
#     the conf read at server start.
# Idempotent on restart: a stale socket a dead server left behind (the
# socket dir is a shared volume) is detected and removed before start.
